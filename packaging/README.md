# skrop packaging

skrop requires [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips). This directory contains a build script and a Dockerfile to build a production-ready Docker image that includes the latest libvips version.

In order to build a Docker image, simply run the `build.sh` script from the root directory of the skrop project.
